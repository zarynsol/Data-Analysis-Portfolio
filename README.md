# Zaryn Solanki - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Welcome to my data analysis journey! I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo, focusing on Computational Math and Statistics. This portfolio serves as my digital playground, a place where I showcase my skills, share my projects, and track my progress in all things data analytics and data science.

I spend a lot of my free time learning about cool stuff like machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm still getting the hang of things, but I love working on projects and digging into resources outside of class to learn even more.

From crunching numbers to playing around with AI, I'm eager to explore it all and see where it takes me.

Check out my resume [here](link), and take a peek at my portfolio to see the projects I've been working on. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy seeing my journey unfold!
