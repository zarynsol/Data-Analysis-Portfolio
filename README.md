# Zaryn Solanki - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Welcome to my data analysis journey! I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo, focusing on Computational Math and Statistics. This portfolio serves as my digital playground, a place where I showcase my skills, share my projects, and track my progress in all things data analytics and data science.

I spend a lot of my free time learning about cool stuff like machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm still getting the hang of things, but I love working on projects and digging into resources outside of class to learn even more.

From crunching numbers to playing around with AI, I'm eager to explore it all and see where it takes me.

Check out my resume [here](link), and take a peek at my portfolio to see the projects I've been working on. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy seeing my journey unfold!

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I'll showcase various data analytics projects, providing brief descriptions of the technology stack used to solve each case.

### Hospitality Domain Dashboard: Analyzing Hotel Bookings
**DAX Formulas:** [idk ]()

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
